# MRC Visualizer ðŸ§©

Interactive web-based tool for **building** and **simulating** modular-robot configurations (MRC).  
Current release ships two modes:

| Mode | What you can do |
|------|-----------------|
| **Config** | Paint voxels, drag to resize/colour, snap-reposition, edit JSON metadata, import/export `.scene.json`. |
| **Movement** | Select modules, step them under full physical/graph constraints, scrub timeline, undo/redo, watch live stats & warnings. |

> **Status:** active development â€“ core architecture finished, Config & Movement feature-complete.  
> Future roadmap: Algorithm Visualize / Train modes (stubbed in repo).
